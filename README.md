# Life simulation

## How to turn it on?
On Windows you just need to clone the repo and use the **life-sim.exe** file included in the main directory. On linux 
you can use linux executable file **life-sim**. Remember to not take them out of the main directory!


## Building instructions
If you do not trust random executables you can always build it yourself. We recommend cmake with vcpkg to handle all dependencies.
