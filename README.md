# Life simulation

## How to turn it on?
On Windows you just need to clone the repo and use the **life-sim.exe** file included in the main directory. On linux 
you can use linux executable file **life-sim**. Remember to not take them out of the main directory!


## Building instructions
If you do not trust random executables you can always build it yourself. We recommend cmake with vcpkg to handle all dependencies.

## Controls
While inside the simulation you can use the following controls:

| Key    | Action                                        |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| P      | Toggle to turn the simulation on or off       |
| K      | Toggle to resource visibility (on by default) |
| L      | Toggle to white background (on by default)    |
| WASD   | Controls to move through the simulation map   |
| ENTER  | Go one step through the simulation            |
| SPACE  | Go through the simulation while it is pushed  |
| SCROLL | To change the size of the map                 |
| F      | Toggle to fullscreen (off by default)         |
